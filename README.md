# CaseAPI

CaseAPI is a specialized API designed exclusively for integrating with the CaseOpening plugin developed by me. It allows other plugins to interact with cases, track statistics and even more, but it requires [CaseOpening](https://github.com) to function properly.

## üîß Installation

### **Maven**
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.tommyyy-dev</groupId>
    <artifactId>CaseAPI</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

### **Gradle (Kotlin DSL)**
```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://jitpack.io")
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly("com.github.tommyyy-dev:CaseAPI:2.0.1")
}
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **1. Hook into CaseAPI**
Before using the API, you need to obtain an instance of `CaseAPI`. This can be done using the Bukkit Services Manager:

```java
private CaseAPI caseAPI;

@Override
public void onEnable() {
    RegisteredServiceProvider<CaseAPI> provider = getServer().getServicesManager().getRegistration(CaseAPI.class);
    if (provider != null) {
        caseAPI = provider.getProvider();
    }
}
```

### **2. Add the Plugin as a Dependency**
To ensure your plugin loads after CaseOpening, you need to declare it as a dependency in your plugin.yml:

```yaml
depend: [CaseOpening]
```

This allows you to safely access the CaseAPI during the onEnable() phase.

### **3. Opening a Case**
You can open a case for a player with or without removing it from them:

```java
boolean success = caseAPI.openCaseWithRemove(player, "example_case");
if (success) {
    player.sendMessage("You have successfully opened a case!");
}
```

### **4. Managing Cases**
You can add or remove cases from a player:

```java
caseAPI.addCases(player, "example_case", 5);
caseAPI.removeCases(player, "example_case", 2);
```

### **5. Listening to Case Events**
You can listen to CaseOpening events to trigger custom actions:

```java
@EventHandler
public void onCaseOpen(CaseOpenEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    player.sendMessage("You are opening a case: " + event.getCaseId());
}

@EventHandler
public void onCaseReward(CaseOpenCompleteEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    if (event.getCaseReward() instanceof MoneyCaseReward moneyCaseReward) {
        player.sendMessage("You have won: " + moneyCaseReward.getAmount());
    }
}
```

If you want to work with the reward or perform actions after the case has been opened and all calculations are complete, you should use the `CaseOpenCompleteEvent`. This event is triggered after all reward calculations have been finalized, ensuring that you are working with the correct result.

On the other hand, the `CaseOpenEvent` is only triggered at the beginning of the case opening process and should not be used for reward-related actions. Additionally, please note that the `CaseOpenCompleteEvent` is **not cancellable**, whereas the `CaseOpenEvent` is **cancellable**.

## üß† Versioning Notice

Although this is the first official public release, the version starts at `2.0.0` due to earlier internal tags (`1.0.0` and `1.1.0`) which are now outdated and permanently cached by JitPack.

Please do **not** use version `1.0.0`, as it does not reflect the current state of the project and will lead to errors. The first stable version is `2.0.0`, and all future updates will follow semantic versioning starting from this version.
